# shutter

"Shutter" is a fully responsive PSD conversion with sound and animation effects.

Turn on the sound for the best experience!

This shows I can successfully recreate a PSD and work collaboratively with designers using my good eye for design and details.

## Usage:
This single page website is for featuring Shutter, a photography company, using example photographs and sections to effectively market the company's brand.

## Built with:
- Vanilla JavaScript
- jQuery
- CSS3
- Floats (Of course, I know Flexbox and Grid, too!)
- HTML5

## To-Do's
Some things I'd love to include to improve the site:
- turning it into a multi-page site with full "about", "blog", and gallery sections.
